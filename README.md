# ACyCLIC - Auto Completition CommandLine InterfaCe


## Project

  * [ACyCLIC at GitHub](https://github.com/sven/acyclic)


## Ports

  * Linux (eg. Ubuntu 16.10)
  * Atmega8 (eg. myAVR Board MK1)
  * Atmega328p (eg. Arduino Uno, Arduino Nano)


## Quickstart

  * Install necessary compilers, tools and libs: gcc or avr-gcc
  * Compile your port

```
    # Linux (runs a little test script after compilation)
    make linux
    ./build/acyclic

    # Atmega8
    make atmega8
    make flash_atmega8

    # Atmega328p
    make atmega328p
    make flash_arduino_nano
```


## Footprint

A small overview of the current footprint when compiling the application that
is used for the testcases is shown here.
